# Architecture

High-level view only. Choices that are hard to reverse are recorded in [decisions/](decisions/).

## Goal

A portfolio a recruiter can read in under a minute, with enough personality to be remembered, and a visible history of how it improved.

## The site

One page, three files, no build step:

| File | Job |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | All content and structure. Each section is a floor of the building. |
| `assets/styles.css` | Layout, both themes, motion. Colours come from tokens in `:root` and `[data-theme]`. |
| `assets/main.js` | Behaviour: theme toggle, floor navigation, sky motion, scroll effects. |

`content/resume.md` is the only source of facts. Nothing appears on the site unless it is in that file first.

## Hosting

GitHub Pages serves `main` at https://ad-nap.github.io/portfolio/. `_config.yml` keeps project files (docs, backlog, reviews, tooling) out of the published site, so only `index.html` and `assets/` are public pages.

## Quality gate

```
edit site file ──► npm run -s check ──► pass ──► done
                        │
                        └── fail ──► fix ──► re-check
```

- `.claude/skills/design-review/` holds the checker (`scripts/check.js`) and the review steps.
- A Stop hook (`.claude/hooks/design-check-on-stop.js`) runs the checker when a Claude Code turn ends with changed site files.
- `.claude/agents/recruiter-critic.md` reviews the site as a hiring manager. Reports land in `reviews/`.

## Versions

One repo. Each version is an annotated tag on `main` plus a GitHub Release with notes. See [decisions/0001-one-repo-tagged-releases.md](decisions/0001-one-repo-tagged-releases.md).
